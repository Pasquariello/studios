The primary challenge was building a custom application that could aggregate large amounts of complex user data in a user-friendly format. Analysts needed the capability to apply custom filters, create complex queries, and easily read and digest the data presented. Additionally, the client faced difficulties in building complex data queries on the front end, annotating and saving documents with editable and searchable annotations, and comparing data side by side in separate windows with real-time updates reflecting user changes.'
