<p style="margin-top: 0"><em>Three Reasons to Start Brewing an MVP Today</em></p>
<br>

<p>
<b>What is an MVP?</b> MVP stands for minimal viable product. This means creating a product that focuses on the absolute core set of functionality to be published to the market. An MVP focuses on delivering a positive user experience and developing a product that aligns with business objectives. It may be called “minimal”, but it showcases the most important features that will attract clients and early investors. You can think of an MVP as a well brewed cup of black coffee. It adds warmth to early mornings and delivers a tasty caffeinated buzz to get you going. A simple cup of coffee is unencumbered and delivers exactly what it promises, just like an MVP should.
</p>

<p>
But don’t let that lead you to think that an MVP is effortless to create. An MVP needs to be thoughtful, well-designed, usable, iterable, and reliable. Oftentimes, people and businesses will overlook the importance of a good MVP and skip this step all together. They soon find themselves with a project that is over budget and over time. Scope creep has gotten the better of them, and at this point, after sinking valuable resources into a project, there is no validation that there is even a need for this product. 
</p>

<p>
Pour yourself a cup of coffee (or tea if you prefer) and take a seat. Let’s explore the reasons why you need an MVP.
</p>

<h3>1. Challenge and Validate Business Assumptions</h3>

<p>
First and foremost you need to validate that there is a need for your product. You may have certain market assumptions or well-established research, but until you actually have something that you can test there is still so much that is left unknown. How will consumers react? Do people even need this? Will you be able to scale? The list goes on.  
</p>

<p>
By taking the time to build an MVP you can get ahead of these questions and bring a product to market. You can test your business assumptions and rapidly iterate on what you’ve learned. 
</p>

<h3>2. Arrive Early to Market and Receive Quick Feedback</h3>

<p>
This goes hand in hand with validating your business assumptions. There are a lot of competitors out there and oftentimes it's not the best product that wins, but the first. The sooner a product is on the market the sooner that product can receive feedback to adapt and grow.  Quick feedback will help you decide what areas of your application need attention. You will more easily be able to adapt, release, retest, and grow.
</p>

<h3>3. Reduce Complexity and Waste</h3>

</p>
Perhaps Peter Drucker said it best, 
</p>

<p style="margin: 24px"><em>
“There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.”
</em></p>
<p>
One of the hardest parts about developing an MVP is sticking to the main features your product needs for deployment. However, by sticking to a rigid set of features you can ensure higher quality, less scope creep, and unnecessary complexity.  You will spend more time developing the features that will make you successful. Some of your biggest advantages of doing this are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>rapid development and continuous progress;</li>
<li>reduced maintenance costs since your product is less complex;</li>
<li>faster release cycles to your customers which in turn means quicker feedback and improved iterations;</li>
<li>and cheaper labor costs since you won't be paying for time intensive complex features.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
Building out a reliable, well-designed, and usable MVP is an absolutely vital step in the process of bringing your ideas to market. By being purposeful in your approach an MVP will help you validate your assumptions, adapt with grace, reduce costs, and save money by cutting down on complexity and wasted feature development.  Building an MVP will help ensure your success in building a usable, reliable and well-designed product.
